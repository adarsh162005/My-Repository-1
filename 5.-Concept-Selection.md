## 5.2 Design Objectives with Weightage
Assign weights to the objectives
| Objectives| Weightage|
|-----------|----------|
| Safety|7|
|Ease of use|8|
|Portability|2|
|Use of standard parts|6|
|Cost|7|
***


## 5.3 Pugh Chart
Write Pugh chart for the 4 alternative designs shown in figures
| Design Objectives| Weightage| Design 1|Design 2|Design 3|Design 4|
|------------------|----------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Safety|7|++|-|0|Datum
|Ease of use|8|+|0|+|Datum
|Portability|2|0|0|+|Datum
|Use of standard parts|6|+|++|+|Datum
|Cost|7|0|-|-|Datum
 | Score(+)||28|12|16|0
 | Score(-)||0|7|7|0
| Total||28|5|9|0

### 5.3 Justification for the score given
|Design| Objectives| Score Allocated| Justification for the score|
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
|1|Safety|14|As electromagnetic material is used the machine is safe|
| | Ease of use|8|there is no complexity to use and simple matarials are used|
|  |Portability|0|Electromagnet matarial is not attached to the machine|
| |Use of standard parts|6|There is usage of standard parts like motors and electromagnetic materials|
| | Cost|0|Standard parts are used sufficiently,so the machine is economic|
|||||
|2|Safety|0|Piston is not safe|
| | Ease of use|0|machine consume more electricity than expected|
|  |Portability|0|machine is not portable enough, since we used lots of standards parts|
| |Use of standard parts|12|we used the standards parts such as motors, pistons and blowers |
| | Cost|-7|Machine is costing more as we used lots of standards parts|
|||||
|3|Safety|7|Motors are well placed.
| | Ease of use|0|Sorting is more efficient.
|  |Portability|-4|More individual parts are used.
| |Use of standard parts|6| Similar parts are used as the Detum
| | Cost|7|Due to more materials used,it costs more
|||||
|4|Safety|0|detum
| | Ease of use|0|detum
|  |Portability|0|detum
| |Use of standard parts|0|detum
| | Cost|0|detum
