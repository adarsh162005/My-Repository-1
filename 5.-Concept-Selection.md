### 5.3 Justification for the score given
|Design| Objectives| Score Allocated| Justification for the score|
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
|1|Safety|14|There is usage of electromagnetic material in the machine which makes it safe|
| | Ease of use|8|There is no complexity in usage of machine and matarials used are simple|
|  |Portability|0|Electromagnet matarial is not attached to the machine,so its not portable|
| |Use of standard parts|6|There is usage of standard parts like motors and electromagnetic materials|
| | Cost|-7|Usage of standard parts is minimum ,so the machine is economic|
|||||
|2|Safety|0|Piston is not safe|
| | Ease of use|0|Machine consumes more electricity than expected|
|  |Portability|0|machine is not portable enough,there is abundant usage of standards parts|
| |Use of standard parts|12|we used the standards parts such as motors, pistons and blowers |
| | Cost|-7|Usage of standard parts abundantly,the machine is expensive |
|||||
|3|Safety|7|Motors are well placed.
| | Ease of use|0|Sorting is more efficient.
|  |Portability|-4|More individual parts are used.
| |Use of standard parts|6| Similar parts are used as the Detum
| | Cost|7|Due to more materials used,it costs more
|||||
|4|Safety|0|detum
| | Ease of use|0|detum
|  |Portability|0|detum
| |Use of standard parts|0|detum
| | Cost|0|detum
