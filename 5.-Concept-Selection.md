## 5.2 Design Objectives with Weightage
Assign weights to the objectives
| Objectives| Weightage|
|-----------|----------|
| Safety|7|
|Ease of use|8|
|Portability|2|
|Use of standard parts|6|
|Cost|7|
***


## 5.3 Pugh Chart
Write Pugh chart for the 4 alternative designs shown in figures
| Design Objectives| Weightage| Design 1|Design 2|Design 3|Design 4|
|------------------|----------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Safety|7|-|Detum|+|-
|Ease of use|8|+|Detum|0|+
|Portability|2|+|Detum|--|+
|Use of standard parts|6|0|Detum|+|++
|Cost|7|+|Detum|+|+
 | Score(+)||17|0|18|29
 | Score(-)||7|0|4|7
| Total||10|0|14|22

### 5.3 Justification for the score given
|Design| Objectives| Score Allocated| Justification for the score|
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------|
|1|Safety|-7|sensors are exposed to the envirment, so it may damage|
| | Ease of use|8|there is no complexity to use and simple matarials are used|
|  |Portability|2|it doesnt have a big size and have light weight witth free body|
| |Use of standard parts|0|there is no usage of standard parts like sensor and etc|
| | Cost|7|there is no use of the standard parts so cost is less|
|2|Safety|0|Detum|
| | Ease of use|0|Detum|
|  |Portability|0|Detum|
| |Use of standard parts|0|Detum|
| | Cost|0|Detum|
|3|Safety|7|Motors are well placed.
| | Ease of use|0|Sorting is more efficient.
|  |Portability|-4|More individual parts are used.
| |Use of standard parts|6| Similar parts are used as the Detum
| | Cost|7|Due to more materials used,it costs more
|4|Safety|-7|As some parts are fixed at a height, they may fall
| | Ease of use|8|All parts are fixed to the main machine.
|  |Portability|2|Less individual parts are used
| |Use of standard parts|12|Usage of parts like Electromagnets and  Sensors
| | Cost|7|Due to more materials used,it costs more
